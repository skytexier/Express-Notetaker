# Express Note Taker

## Description
This application uses Express.js to create a note-taking webpage where users can create new notes, save said notes and delete said notes. 
The motivation behind creating this application was to better understand Express routing and how to create helper functions to handle many requests made through our routes. 
This application aims to recreate a generic note app, however this time through a live server unlike most note applications which may be built into an OS. It works perhaps in similar ways by creating a database, reading previous entries from that database
and ultimately writing new information to that database.

The hardest part of creating this application was getting the helper functions to work together, considering this application was built with a predefined script in the background to handle note creation, deletion and saving on the webpage. Learning how to transfer that data into Express proved challenging, but thankfully a few peers and our class 
provided a lot of useful tools/tips for creating those helper functions/functions in general.

The required installs for this application are listed in the package dependencies, so running `npm i` to install these packages is necessary.
Besides that no installation is require as this server runs on Heroku or on localhost depending how you want to run it.


## Usage/Examples

[This is a video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lR3U2a_Tx7InEp64oWyv1Cja1pxxRUW-/view?usp=sharing) to a basic walkthrough of how this application works. Aside from this one must run `node index` in their terminal to begin the proccess.

Here is a screenshot of what the terminal looks like when generating this HTML page.
